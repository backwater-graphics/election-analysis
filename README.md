# Election Analysis
##Project Overview
We are assisting a Colorado Board of Elections employee Tom in an election audit of the tabulated results for U.S, Congressional precinct in Colorado. There are three primary voting methods that you and Tom will take into account: Mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic or DRE counting Machines. Mail-in ballots are typically hand counted at the central office. Punch cards are collected and then fed inot a machine that tabulates vote totals and sends the results to the central office. Finally memory cards from DRE counting machines are sent to the central office and read by a computer. Altogether the votes cast by these three methods will determine the final election results. After the votes are counted, your job is to generate a vote count report to certify this U.S. congressional race.

### Project Requirements
*Reporting the total number of votes cast
*The total number of votes for each candidate
*The percentage of votes for each candidate
